# HR-Metrics-Case-Study

ðŸŒŸ I recently completed a case study on HR Metrics, specifically focusing on staffing. This involved calculating the costs of hiring both internally and externally. 

ðŸ“Š As an HR Analyst, my responsibilities include collecting, cleaning, and analysing data, as well as creating reports with dashboards. I utilised advanced formulas and functions such as VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, Pivot tables, Histograms, and more.

ðŸ“ŒFurthermore, I have provided recommendations based on comprehensive findings.

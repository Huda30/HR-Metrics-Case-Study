# HR-Metrics-Case-Study

ðŸŒŸ I successfully completed an HR Metrics case study (staffing ) which involved calculating hiring costs for internal and external hires. 

I used advanced formulas and functions such as VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, Pivot tables, Histograms, and more. 

I have also included my recommendations which are based on comprehensive findings.
